**Song Popularity Predictor using Spotify dataset**

**Language:** R

**Editor:** RStudio (v1.2.1335)

**Description:** ML model created and trained on spotify dataset to predict if a song will be popular or
not depending on the several audio features of the song like acousticness, danceability, energy, etc.

**NOTE:**
I came across a spotify dataset on the kaggle repository (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db).
This dataset consisted of the audio features of the song along with the track information and it's popularity on a scale of 0 - 100. 
I filtered data (Informatica Cloud) and scrapped certain genres which had greater standard deviation to minimize processing time. 
I decided to categorize the top 25% of the songs as popular to discover the prominent features that make a song popular.

To discribe my entire project and the flow of the code I also created a video that is uploaded on Youtube.

Basic packages used in the project are *ggplot2, caret, reshape, psych, caretEnsemble, e1071, kernlab, naivebayes,
C50, randomForest, pROC*.
**Models:** Logistic Regression (backfitted), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble Model
